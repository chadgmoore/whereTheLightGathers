# Hello, it's nice to meet you.

I'm a Technical Project Manager, former Game Developer, Animator, and Technical Art Director. I've learned a lot about art, design, and technology in my almost 20 years of creating interactive games, software, companies and other projects. What I find most rewarding and challenging isn't art, design or tech at all. It's the people I've worked with. People create the experiences, stories, design, art and technology; _the things that move us_.

I enjoy teaching and talking as much as doing, I'm available for speaking, workshops, and teaching engagements. I also have some available spots in my [consulting services](http://consulting.wherethelightgathers.com).  Drop me an [email](mailto:chad@chadmoore.net) to discuss.

The name Where the Light gathers comes from a quote spoken in one of my favorite games of all time, The Shadow of the Colossus. 

> Very well. Raise thy sword by the light, and head to the place where the sword's light gathers.

That game was a real influence on me. The character development was very unique and challenging to the player. No spoilers.

Thanks for coming by,    
Chad
